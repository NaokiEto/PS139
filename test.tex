\section*{Attempt at finding the p-value}

Benford's Law is expecting a mean of 3.71465. So, we can have:

$H_{0}: m = 3.7146$

\vspace{2 mm}

$H_{1}: m \leq 3.7146$

\vspace{2 mm}
\noindent
The mean of data points' first digits is 2.9758.
The population standard devation is 1.5266.
The number of data points is 19827.

\vspace{2 mm}
\noindent
Computing the z score:

\vspace{2 mm}
$z = \frac{2.9758 - 3.71465}{\frac{1.5266}{\sqrt{198275}}} = -68.146$

\vspace{2 mm}
\noindent
So, the p-value is about $0.00 \le 0.05$, which seems to indicate that fraud has occurred.
